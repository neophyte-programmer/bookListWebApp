# BOOK LIST WEB APP

## Overview
This is a web app that helps the user to create, store and delete books. THis prooject is similar to another one of my repos but that one is a non - responsive todo list web app. However, like the ToDO list web app, this web app stores the data on the local storage.

## Experience
Since I am in my early stages of learning JavaScript, I did find this quite challenging so as usual, youtube and google to the rescue. I did make use of this concept that is new to me, Bootstrap. This saved me all the time i would have used for CSS styling and stuff like that. I also applied object oriented programming concepts from C++, classes to also make things easier.
